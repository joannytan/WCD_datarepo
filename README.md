# WCD_datarepo
Data for the week 09 tute for wild caught data.

This repo contains two **simulated** datasets for the use of students in Wild Caught Data, 2022. 

Descriptions of the data below:

survey_data.csv
This is simulated data designed to represent a medical survey. The hypothetical premise is that participants were invited to attend a center to take part in a short study investigating blood sugar levels and eating habits. The data was openly released with variables including the date and time of testing (morning (9-11:59), afternoon(12:00-4:59), evening(5 - 9pm), coding whether the respondent had high blood sugar (measured in binary high/normal), their age (measured in years), their sex (M/F). 

blood_donation.csv

As participants were leaving the trial, they were asked if they would consider giving blood to save lives. All said yes. As part of a promotion run by the center, blood donors were asked if they would consider giving their age, sex and name to be published on the website to encourage others to give blood. All consented and data was uploaded in real time (which is represented by date and time in the dataset). 

Both of these datasets are completely synthetic and not intended to replicate any real world data scenario in particular. They are used as a teaching tool and **are not intended in any way for analysis**

The simulation script is also included for posterity, but students do not need to use this.
